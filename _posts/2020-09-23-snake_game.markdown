The more I learn about coding, the more I realized there are a lot more to learn haha. But at the same timeI feel more confident about handling them.

The connection between css, html, and javascript finally becomes clearer to me! **Things to work on: JQuery**. Many of the online posts that I found answers from used JQuery. It might be very useful to learn that.

In the lessons, we learnt to use `.to_json()`, and `includes:, except:` to create a json for the API. For this app, I want the information information to be short and sweet. So I created a class method to organize the infomation in a neat style and still keep the json formatting short and clean.

I think I didn't encounter too much trouble this time. Maybe because my interface is pretty simple. I want to explore more games and excersice on the style and logic.

It's a fun game~ feel free to have fun with me!
