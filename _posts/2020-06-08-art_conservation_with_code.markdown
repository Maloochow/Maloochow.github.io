Hi, since this is the first blog post, please allow me to do a little self introduction. I am Malu. This May, I began my journey to learn coding. Before this, I worked as a product manager for new media art projects. I worked with companies such as Shisheido, Oreo, and numerous galleries. The goal of my work is to figure out what is the best way to present an artist work--in my case, it's usually time-based media art.

My biggest concern at work is how to allow people to revisit these works in 10 years. I met artist who used Flash to create generative video artwork and was unable to make it work again in 5 years. I saw many artsts sending in a big screens dedicated to a certain piece of their work and write a 10-year warranty for the device. Not to mention the artworks that works with sensors, live website interactions, and etc. Where will these artwork live after generations of software updates?

I believe learning to code is the baby step that I can take to be part of this conversation. I want to be able to understand the challenges that is faced by certain artworks and provide solutions. Coding is the language to communicate with these artworks and I want to be fluent in it.
